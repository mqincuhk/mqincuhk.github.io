# **Welcome to my homepage**
I am a final year Ph.D. Candidate from The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html)), supervised by Professor [Wei-Hsin Liao](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liao-wei-hsin/). My research mainly focuses on toolpath generation and optimization algorithms for additive manufacturing. 


I will continue with my postdoctoral research after graduation.
