# **Welcome to my homepage**

I am a final year Ph.D. Candidate from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by Professor [Wei-Hsin Liao](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liao-wei-hsin/). Before that, I obtained a Master's degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University and Bachelor's degree from Guangxi University. My research mainly focuses on toolpath generation and optimization algorithms for additive manufacturing. 

After graduation, I will move on to conduct postdoctoral studies.
